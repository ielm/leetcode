/**
 * [322] Coin Change
 *
 * You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.
 * Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.
 * You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 *
 * Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
 *
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 *
 * Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
 * Output: -1
 *
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 *
 * Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
 * Output: 0
 *
 *  
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= coins.length <= 12
 * 1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1
 * 0 <= amount <= 10^4
 *
