# Arrays

Arrays are a linear data structure that stores elements in contiguous memory locations. Because of the contiguous memory allocation, any element of an array can be accessed in constant time. However, inserting and deleting elements from an array is expensive because the elements need to be shifted to maintain the contiguous memory allocation. The time complexity of inserting and deleting elements from an array is O(n).

## Some miscellaneous array topics

### Array Reversal

Reversing an array means shifting the elements of an array in a reverse manner. The time complexity of reversing an array is O(n).

There are various ways to reverse an array, including methods like the two pointer technique, recursion, and using a stack.

### Array Rotation

Array rotation is the process of moving the elements of an array to the left or right by a certain number of positions. There are various ways to rotate an array, including methods like the reversal algorithm, the block swap algorithm, and using a temporary array.

Basically, given an array, the task is to cyclically rotate the array clockwise by n.
